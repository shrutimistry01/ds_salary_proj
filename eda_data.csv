Data Scientist job Responsibilities

Combining computer science, modeling, statistics, analytics, and math skills—along with sound business sense—data scientists uncover the answers to major questions that help organizations make objective decisions. The ability to transform a sea of data into actionable insights can have a profound impact—for predicting the best new diabetes treatment to identifying and thwarting national security threats. That’s why businesses and government agencies are rushing to hire data science professionals who can help do just that. The first step toward establishing an active data analytics platform is to collect structured and unstructured data from different sources. Unstructured data consists of things like what customers are saying about the organization on social media, while structured data is a measurable metric, such as customer lifetime value.

A data scientist cleans and validates the data to ensure its accuracy and completeness. While AI-powered data analytics tools can automate part of this process, cleaning data still makes up the bulk of a data scientist’s job duties. Once the data is clean, the data scientist analyzes the data to identify patterns and trends using advanced statistics skills. Work throughout the organization to identify opportunities for leveraging company data to drive business solutions. Develop custom data models and algorithms to apply data sets. Strong problem solving skills with an emphasis on product development.

About Us

CryptoMize is a Conglomerate Digital Agency with presence in 3 Continents evolving for a decade, having served elite clients such as Governments, Politicians, MNCs, Celebrities and HNIs in 30+ Countries.
